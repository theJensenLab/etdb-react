Chemotaxis is mediated by a large hexagonally-packed array of chemoreceptors, which sense the signal and transmit the information to soluble effector molecules inside the cell. The architecture of these chemoreceptor arrays is conserved across bacteria and archaea.  Chemoreceptor arrays are usually associated with the membrane, but some cells contain cytoplasmic arrays, too, consisting of two layers of chemoreceptors.",

Other species produce exospores that are released to the environment directly.  Once a spore encounters favorable conditions, it transitions back to a metabolically active (and environmentally vulnerable) cell.",

Type VI secretion systems assemble in the cytoplasm of the cell, attached to the membrane. To fire, the outer sheath contracts into a shorter, wider conformation, powering the ejection of the inner rod into the target cell.  Huge arrays of a related structure in a marine bacterium are released by lysis.  These arrays provide a signal for a tubeworm to settle onto a surface and differentiate, so they're known as morphogenesis-associated contractile structures (MACs).",
